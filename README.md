## Environment 

- React Version: 16.13.1
- Node Version: 12(LTS)
- Default Port: 8000

## Functionality Requirements

Implement the following functionalities:

- All transactions are initially displayed inside the table in the order they are retrieved from the source. The source is the getTransactions function in the record-table.component.ts file in the repository.

- Picking the date from the date input and pressing the `Filter` button should display all the records for that date in the table. If no date is chosen, the `Filter` button should not do anything.

- Clicking on the `Amount ($)` table header should sort the records in ascending order of amount. The behavior is the same for multiple clicks on `Amount ($)`.

Each transaction object contains the following properties : 
- `String` date: The date when the transaction took place in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
- `String` description: The description of the transaction.
- `Number` type: The type of transaction, where 0 denotes a credit transaction and 1 denotes a debit transaction.
- `Float` amount: The total amount of the transaction.
- `String` balance: The balance of the account after the transaction was completed, prefixed with a dollar sign ($).

```

    "date": "2019-12-03",

    "type": 0,
    "amount": 1985.4,
    "balance": "$12,234.45"
  }
```
